			I've been keeping something from you. It may not seem like much, but it took a long time to convince myself it was worth doing and sharing with people. I've been making music in secret for several months. I've been toying with the idea of telling you about it but decided to keep it to myself. I picked the name Greer because I didn't want to use my own. It felt right for some reason. I've been talking myself out of this every day for months. I have to give myself reasons why something I could make would matter because it seems so hard to make something that does. This feels strange because self-promotion feels vain and uncomfortable. But it also feels strange that I kept this to myself until now. I'm not sure if anyone will like it, but I needed to do it. I've thought about wanting to do this for a long time. This is just the beginning, I hope.<br /><br />
